# Assignment I

```{r}
# Given probabilities
P_T <- 0.8  # Probability of being on time
P_Tbar <- 0.2  # Probability of not being on time
P_S <- 0.3  # Probability of a change in scope
P_Sbar <- 0.7  # Probability of no change in scope

# Calculating probabilities
P_T_and_S <- P_T * P_S
P_T_and_Sbar <- P_T * P_Sbar
P_Tbar_and_S <- P_Tbar * P_S
P_Tbar_and_Sbar <- P_Tbar * P_Sbar

# Sum of probabilities
sum_of_probabilities <- P_T_and_S + P_T_and_Sbar + P_Tbar_and_S + P_Tbar_and_Sbar

# Displaying the results

# Assignment II
```{r}
# Given probabilities
P_A <- 0.423
P_B <- 0.278
P_C <- 0.1
P_AB <- 0.073
P_BC <- 0.033
P_AC <- 0.088
P_ABC <- 0.005

# Percentage of customers using all three devices
P_all_three <- P_ABC * 100
P_all_three

# Calculate the percentage of customers using at least two devices
P_at_least_two <- (P_A + P_B + P_C - P_AB - P_BC - P_AC + P_ABC) * 100
P_at_least_two

# Calculate the percentage of customers using only one device
P_only_one <- (P_A - P_AB - P_AC + P_ABC + P_B - P_AB - P_BC + P_ABC + P_C - P_AC -P_BC + P_ABC) * 100
P_only_one

```

# Assignment III
```{r}
# Given probabilities
P_B_A <- 0.97
P_B_notA <- 0.01
P_A <- 0.04
not_P_A <- 1 - P_A

# Calculate the probability B
P_B <- P_B_A * P_A + P_B_notA* not_P_A
P_B

# Calculate the probability A|B
P_A_B <- P_B_A * P_A /P_B
P_A_B

# Calculate the probability not_A|B
P_not_A_B <- P_B_notA * not_P_A / P_B
P_not_A_B

The following sentence:
These results show that in case the alarm is triggered, there is a possibility of about 19.83% that the product is flawless and a probability of 80.16% that the product is faulty.
