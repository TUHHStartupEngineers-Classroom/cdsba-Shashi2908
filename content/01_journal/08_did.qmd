# Assignment

```{r}
# Load necessary Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# Load the file
hospdd <- readRDS("Causal_Data_Science_Data/hospdd.rds")
# Create a Data Frame
df=data.frame(hospdd)
head(df)
```

1.Compute mean satisfactions 
```{r}
# Convert month to a numeric variable
df$month <- as.numeric(as.character(df$month))
# Create a binary indicator for the post-treatment period
df$treatment <- ifelse(df$month >= 4, 1, 0)  # Assuming treatment occurred after month 3

# Calculate mean satisfaction for control hospitals before and after treatment
mean_satisfaction_control_before <- df %>%
  filter(procedure == 0, treatment == 0) %>%
  summarise(mean_satisfaction = sum(satis) / length(satis)) %>%
  pull(mean_satisfaction)

mean_satisfaction_control_after <- df %>%
  filter(procedure == 0, treatment == 1) %>%
  summarise(mean_satisfaction = sum(satis) / length(satis)) %>%
  pull(mean_satisfaction)

# Calculate mean satisfaction for treated hospitals before and after treatment
mean_satisfaction_treated_before <- df %>%
  filter(procedure == 1, treatment == 0) %>%
  summarise(mean_satisfaction = sum(satis) / length(satis)) %>%
  pull(mean_satisfaction)

mean_satisfaction_treated_after <- df %>%
  filter(procedure == 1, treatment == 1) %>%
  summarise(mean_satisfaction = sum(satis) / length(satis)) %>%
  pull(mean_satisfaction)

# Print the results
cat("Mean Satisfaction for Control Hospitals Before Treatment:", mean_satisfaction_control_before, "\n")
cat("Mean Satisfaction for Control Hospitals After Treatment:", mean_satisfaction_control_after, "\n")
cat("Mean Satisfaction for Treated Hospitals Before Treatment:", mean_satisfaction_treated_before, "\n")
cat("Mean Satisfaction for Treated Hospitals After Treatment:", mean_satisfaction_treated_after, "\n")

```

2. Using a linear regression to compute and estimate:
```{r}
# 2.1 Linear regression with month + hospital
lm_satis <- lm(procedure ~ month + hospital, data = df)
summary(lm_satis)
```

```{r}
# 2.2 Linear regression as.factor(month) + as.factor(hospital)
lm_satis <- lm(procedure ~ as.factor(month) + as.factor(hospital), data = df)
summary(lm_satis)
```
The difference is that the factor function gives detailed values of the estimates for all the months and all the hospitals whereas the normal regression is only confined to two coefficients.
